Wynncraft-specific camera utilities, inspired by the mod Nimble. Fixes weird third-person bugs during Wynncraft cutscenes and adds many features from the famous Nimble mod by Snownee. Still early in development, and made for my modpack [World of Wynncraft](https://modrinth.com/modpack/world-of-wynncraft)

## What's Up
- Automatically switches to third-person view when mounting horses, boats, or minecarts
- Switches back to your original perspective when dismounting
- The third-person front view now requires holding Left Alt
- Fixes third person view bugs during Wynncraft cutscenes and death animations
- Configurable keybinds for toggling perspective and front view

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
2. Download the latest version of Nimble Rewynnded from the versions page
3. Place the downloaded .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder
4. Ride off into the Wynncraft sunset

## Future Features
- Smooth camera transitions will be added once Nimble updates to 1.21
- More robust Wynncraft cutscene detection

This mod creates its own section in the change keybinds menu so just make sure to set your new keybinds in that section.
